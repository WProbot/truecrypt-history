There are blowfish assembler generation scripts.
bf-586.pl version is for the pentium and
bf-686.pl is my original version, which is faster on the pentium pro

When using bf-586.pl, the pentium pro/II code is %8 slower than bf-686.pl
When using bf-686.pl, the pentium code is %16 slower than bf-586.pl

So the default is bf-586.pl
